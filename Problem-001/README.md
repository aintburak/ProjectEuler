# Project Euler - Problem 1

## `Multiples of 3 and 5`

### Problem Statement

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Instructions

1. Solve the problem by finding the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
2. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
3. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
4. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For the numbers below 10:
- Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9 (sum = 18)
- Multiples of 5: 5 (sum = 5)

The total sum is 18 + 5 = 23.

### Discussion

This problem involves finding and summing the multiples of 3 or 5 within a given range. Consider efficient approaches to compute the sum without explicitly checking each number.
