# Project Euler - Problem 40

## `Champernowne's Constant`

### Problem Statement

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers: 0.123456789101112131415161718192021...

If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression:

d1 × d10 × d100 × d1000 × d10000 × d100000 × d1000000

### Instructions

1. Generate Champernowne's constant by concatenating the positive integers.
2. Extract the specified digits from the constant.
3. Multiply the extracted digits together.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the specified digits (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000), the product of the corresponding digits in Champernowne's constant is to be found.

### Discussion

This problem involves efficiently generating Champernowne's constant and extracting specific digits from it. An optimized approach is necessary due to the potentially large size of Champernowne's constant.
