# Project Euler - Problem 34

## `Digit Factorials`

### Problem Statement

145 is a curious number because the sum of its digits' factorials is equal to 145:

1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

**Note:** As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

### Instructions

1. Iterate through numbers and calculate the sum of the factorial of their digits.
2. Check if the number is equal to the sum of the factorial of its digits.
3. Sum all numbers that meet the criteria.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the number 145:
- Digits: 1, 4, 5
- Sum of factorial of digits: 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

### Discussion

This problem involves calculating factorials and checking numbers for the specified property. Efficient factorial computation and digit manipulation are key to solving this problem.
