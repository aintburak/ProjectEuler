## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are designed to be solved programmatically and are a great way to improve your algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

Visit the official Project Euler website: [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Getting Started

To run and test the solutions in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your machine. The solutions are organized by problem number in the `src/` directory.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/))

### Running a Solution

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aintburak/ProjectEuler.git
```

Navigate to the problem you want to run:

```bash
cd ProjectEuler/src/ProblemX
```

Compile and run the C++ file {replace X with the specific problem number that you'd like to work with hands-on-xp :) }

```bash
g++ ProblemX.cpp -o ProblemX
./ProblemX
```

## Solutions
The solutions are implemented in C++, mostly unless i change my mind :D, no worries hopefully im planning to solve in different languages such as python, java and so on .. and can be found in the src/ directory. Each problem has its own folder named ProblemX, where X is the problem number.

Note: Solutions may contain spoilers, so it's recommended to attempt solving the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute additional solutions or improvements to existing ones, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b feature-name.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new solution for ProblemX'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request, hopefully i'll see u around :3
