## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. The problems are designed to be solved programmatically and are a great way to improve your algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

Visit the official Project Euler website: [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Getting Started

To run and test the solutions in this repository, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your machine. The solutions are organized by problem number in the `src/` directory.

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/))

### Running a Solution

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aintburak/ProjectEuler.git
```

Navigate to the problem you want to run:

```bash
cd ProjectEuler/src/ProblemX
```

Compile and run the C++ file {replace X with the specific problem number that you'd like to work with hands-on-xp :) }

```bash
g++ ProblemX.cpp -o ProblemX
./ProblemX
```

## Solutions
The solutions are implemented in C++, mostly unless i change my mind :D, no worries hopefully im planning to solve in different languages such as python, java and so on .. and can be found in the src/ directory. Each problem has its own folder named ProblemX, where X is the problem number.

Note: Solutions may contain spoilers, so it's recommended to attempt solving the problems on your own before referring to the solutions.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute additional solutions or improvements to existing ones, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature: git checkout -b feature-name.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new solution for ProblemX'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request, hopefully i'll see u around :3

## License
This project is licensed under the `MIT License` - see the `LICENSE` file for details.

To sum up, please don't hesitate to customize this template solutions based on your preferences and the specific details of your Project Euler solutions repository. Thank youu for passing by this fundamental repo, and also feel free to keep in touch with me via github or mail.
