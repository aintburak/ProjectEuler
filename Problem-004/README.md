# Project Euler - Problem 4

## Largest Palindrome Product

### Problem Statement

A palindromic number reads the same backward as forward. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Instructions

1. Generate the product of all possible pairs of 3-digit numbers.
2. Identify palindromic numbers among the generated products.
3. Determine the largest palindromic number.
4. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
5. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
6. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For 2-digit numbers:
- Possible products: 91 × 99 = 9009
- Largest palindromic number: 9009

### Discussion

This problem involves finding palindromic numbers that result from the product of two 3-digit numbers. Consider efficient ways to check for palindromes and generate product pairs.
