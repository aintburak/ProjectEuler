# Project Euler - Problem 36

## `Double-base Palindromes`

### Problem Statement

The decimal number 585 is palindromic in both base 10 and base 2 (binary). The decimal representation is 585, and the binary representation is 1001001001. 

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in both base 10 and base 2.

**NOTE:** The palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.

### Instructions

1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to 999,999.
2. Check if a number is palindromic in both base 10 and base 2.
3. Sum all numbers that meet the criteria.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the number 585:
- Decimal: 585 (palindromic)
- Binary: 1001001001 (palindromic)

### Discussion

This problem involves checking numbers for palindromic properties in both decimal and binary bases. Efficient conversion between bases and palindromic checking are essential for solving this problem.
