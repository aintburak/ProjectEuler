# Project Euler - Problem 48

## `Self Powers`

### Problem Statement

The series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 10^10 = 10405071317.

Find the last ten digits of the series, 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000.

### Instructions

1. Calculate the sum of the series where each term is a number raised to the power of itself from 1 to 1000.
2. Determine the last ten digits of this sum.
3. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
4. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
5. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For numbers up to 10:
- The sum of self powers is 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 10^10 = 10405071317.

### Discussion

This problem involves large number arithmetic and modular calculations to handle the potentially very large integers involved. Efficient computation strategies and memory management are key.
