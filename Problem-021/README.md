# Project Euler - Problem 21

## Description

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under N.

## Example

For N = 10000:
- The sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000 is 31626.

## Run the Code

To solve the problem, you can use a programming language of your choice and create a script or program. Iterate through numbers less than N and check for amicable pairs using the definition provided.
