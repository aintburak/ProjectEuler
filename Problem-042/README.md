# Project Euler - Problem 42

## Coded Triangle Numbers

### Problem Statement

The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, Tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values, we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = T10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words.txt (right-click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?

### Instructions

1. Read the provided text file containing English words.
2. Calculate the word value for each word by summing up the alphabetical positions of its letters.
3. Determine if each word value is a triangle number.
4. Count the number of words that are triangle words.
5. Output the result.

### Example

For the word "SKY", the word value is 55, which is a triangle number (T10). So, "SKY" is a triangle word.

### Discussion

This problem involves calculating triangle numbers and checking if the word values of given words are triangle numbers. Efficient methods for generating triangle numbers and determining whether a number is a triangle number can be employed.
