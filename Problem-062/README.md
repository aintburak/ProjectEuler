# Project Euler - Problem 62

## `Cubic Permutations`

### Problem Statement

The cube, 41063625 (345³), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (384³) and 66430125 (405³). In other words, they have the same digits but in different orders.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.

### Instructions

1. Compute the cubes of natural numbers.
2. Store these cubes and check for digit permutations among them.
3. Identify the smallest cube for which there are exactly five permutations of its digits that are also cubes.
4. Output the result.

### Example

Identify the smallest number whose cube has exactly five permutations that are cubes of other numbers.

### Discussion

This problem requires exploring the properties of numbers and their cubes, focusing on permutations. Efficient handling and checking of permutations are essential to solving the problem, given the potentially large numbers involved.
