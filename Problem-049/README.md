# Project Euler - Problem 49

## `Prime Permutations`

### Problem Statement

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways:
1. Each of the three terms are prime.
2. Each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

Find the 12-digit number formed by concatenating the three terms in this sequence.

### Instructions

1. Identify the sequence of three 4-digit prime numbers, each being a permutation of the others, that forms an arithmetic sequence.
2. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
3. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
4. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

The sequence 1487, 4817, 8147 is a set of three primes where each number is a permutation of the others and they form an arithmetic sequence with a difference of 3330.

### Discussion

This problem involves identifying prime numbers that are permutations of each other and also form an arithmetic sequence. This requires both prime checking and a method to verify permutations efficiently.
