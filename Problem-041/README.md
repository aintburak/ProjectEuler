# Project Euler - Problem 41

## `Pandigital Prime`

### Problem Statement

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

### Instructions

1. Generate all n-digit pandigital numbers for decreasing values of n.
2. Check each pandigital number for primality.
3. Identify the largest pandigital prime.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the pandigital number 2143, it is a 4-digit pandigital prime.

### Discussion

This problem involves generating pandigital numbers and checking their primality. Efficient methods for checking primality and generating pandigital numbers are essential for solving this problem.
