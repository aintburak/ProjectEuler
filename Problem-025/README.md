# Project Euler - Problem 25

## 1000-digit Fibonacci number

### Problem Statement

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1.

Hence, the first 12 terms will be:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

The 12th term, 144, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

### Instructions

1. Find the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits.
2. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
3. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
4. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For example, the first Fibonacci number with three digits is 144, which is at index 12.

### Discussion

This problem involves generating Fibonacci numbers until a number with 1000 digits is found. Consider efficient methods for generating Fibonacci numbers and handling large numbers in your implementation.
