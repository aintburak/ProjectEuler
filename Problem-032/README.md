# Project Euler - Problem 32

## `Pandigital Products`

## Problem Statement

We are asked to find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital. These are products that can be formed by concatenating the multiplicand, multiplier, and the product to form a 1 through 9 pandigital number. A pandigital number is a number that contains each of the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

For example, if we take the product 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, we get a pandigital identity because the concatenated number 391867254 contains each digit from 1 to 9 exactly once.

## Objectives

1. Identify all combinations of multiplicand, multiplier, and product that can form a 1 through 9 pandigital number.
2. Ensure that each of these combinations is unique and no product is counted more than once.
3. Sum all the unique products that result from these combinations.
