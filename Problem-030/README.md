# Project Euler Problem - 30
## `Digit Fifth Powers`

## Problem Statement

The task is to find all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits and then compute the sum of these numbers. For example, the number 1634 is one such number because \(1^5 + 6^5 + 3^5 + 4^5 = 1634\).

## Objectives

1. Identify all numbers that can be expressed as the sum of the fifth powers of their digits.
2. Calculate the sum of all these numbers to find the final answer.
