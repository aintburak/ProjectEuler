# Project Euler - Problem 50

## `Consecutive Prime Sum`

### Problem Statement

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds up to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds up to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Find which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes.

### Instructions

1. Solve the problem by identifying the prime number below one-million that can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes.
2. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
3. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
4. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

Prime 953 can be written as the sum of 21 consecutive primes below one-thousand.

### Discussion

This problem involves identifying prime numbers and finding the longest sequence of consecutive primes that sum to another prime. This requires an efficient algorithm for prime checking and sum computation.
