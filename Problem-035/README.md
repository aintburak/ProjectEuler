# Project Euler Problem - 35
## `Circular Primes`

## Problem Statement

The task is to find all prime numbers below one million that remain prime under all rotations of their digits. For example, 197 is a circular prime because all rotations of its digits (197, 971, and 719) are themselves prime.

## Objectives

1. Identify all prime numbers below one million that are circular primes.
2. Count the total number of these circular primes.
