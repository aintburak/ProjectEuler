# Project Euler - Problem 2

## `Even Fibonacci Numbers`

### Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Instructions

1. Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a certain limit.
2. Identify even-valued terms among these Fibonacci numbers.
3. Sum up the even-valued terms.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the Fibonacci sequence up to 10 terms, the even-valued terms are 2 and 8, and their sum is 10.

### Discussion

This problem involves efficiently generating Fibonacci numbers and identifying even-valued terms within the sequence. A straightforward algorithm can be implemented to find the solution.
