# Project Euler - Problem 2

## Even Fibonacci Numbers

### Problem Statement

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Instructions

1. Find the Fibonacci sequence terms up to a certain limit (four million in this case).
2. Identify the even-valued terms in the sequence.
3. Sum the identified even-valued terms.
4. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
5. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
6. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For the Fibonacci sequence terms below 10:
- Terms: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (even-valued terms: 2, 8)
- Sum of even-valued terms: 2 + 8 = 10

### Discussion

This problem involves generating Fibonacci sequence terms and summing specific values. Consider efficient ways to generate the sequence and identify even-valued terms.
