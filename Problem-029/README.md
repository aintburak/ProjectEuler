# Project Euler Problem - 29 
## `Distinct Powers`

## Problem Statement

Consider all integer combinations of \(a^b\) for \(2 \leq a \leq 100\) and \(2 \leq b \leq 100\). The task is to find the number of distinct terms generated by these expressions.

## Objectives

1. Compute all the powers \(a^b\) for each pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\) where \(2 \leq a, b \leq 100\).
2. Ensure all computed powers are unique (i.e., no duplicates).
3. Count the total number of distinct terms.
