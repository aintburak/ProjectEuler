# Project Euler - Problem 6

## Sum Square Difference

### Problem Statement

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:

\[1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots + 10^2 = 385\]

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:

\[(1 + 2 + \ldots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025\]

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is:

\[3025 - 385 = 2640\]

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### Instructions

1. Compute the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers.
2. Compute the square of the sum of the first one hundred natural numbers.
3. Find the difference between the results obtained in steps 1 and 2.
4. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
5. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
6. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For the first ten natural numbers:
- Sum of squares: \(1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots + 10^2 = 385\)
- Square of sum: \((1 + 2 + \ldots + 10)^2 = 3025\)
- Difference: \(3025 - 385 = 2640\)

### Discussion

This problem involves calculating the sum of squares and the square of the sum for a given range of natural numbers. Consider efficient ways to perform these calculations.
