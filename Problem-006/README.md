# Project Euler - Problem 6

## `Sum Square Difference`

### Problem Statement

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### Instructions

1. Compute the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers.
2. Compute the square of the sum of the first one hundred natural numbers.
3. Calculate the difference between the two sums.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the first ten natural numbers, the sum of the squares is 385 and the square of the sum is 3025. The difference is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

### Discussion

This problem involves straightforward arithmetic operations on sequences of natural numbers. A simple implementation should suffice to find the desired result efficiently.
