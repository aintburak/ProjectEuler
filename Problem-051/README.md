# Project Euler - Problem 51

## `Prime Digit Replacements`

### Problem Statement

By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *13*, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: *13, 23, 43, 53, 73,* and *83* are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of *56003* with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers: *56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773,* and *56993*. The family of seven primes here are *56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773,* and *56993*, and *56003* being the smallest member.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.

### Instructions

1. Generate prime numbers and examine their digit patterns.
2. Identify patterns where replacing certain digits with the same digit results in multiple prime numbers.
3. Determine the smallest prime that can be part of an eight prime value family through digit replacements.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the number *56003*:
- By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits: *56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, 56993* are all primes.

### Discussion

This problem involves generating prime numbers and finding digit patterns that allow for replacements resulting in multiple primes. Efficient prime generation, digit manipulation, and pattern recognition are essential for solving this problem.
