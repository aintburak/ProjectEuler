## Special Pythagorean Triplet

### Problem Statement

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, \(a < b < c\), for which:

\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]

For example, \(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\) (\(9 + 16 = 25\)).

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which \(a + b + c = 1000\). Find the product \(abc\).

### Instructions

1. Identify the Pythagorean triplet for which \(a + b + c = 1000\).
2. Compute the product \(abc\) of the identified triplet.
3. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
4. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
5. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For the Pythagorean triplet \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), \(c = 5\):
- \(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\) (\(9 + 16 = 25\))
- \(a + b + c = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12\)
- Product \(abc = 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 60\)

### Discussion

This problem involves finding a Pythagorean triplet with a specific sum. Consider efficient ways to iterate through possible values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to find the solution.
