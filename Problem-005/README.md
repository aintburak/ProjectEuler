# Project Euler - Problem 5

## `Smallest Multiple`

### Problem Statement

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### Instructions

1. Find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all numbers from 1 to 20.
2. Output the result.

### Example

For the numbers from 1 to 10, the smallest multiple that satisfies the condition is 2520.

### Discussion

This problem involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a range of numbers. One approach is to compute the LCM iteratively or use prime factorization to find the LCM efficiently.
