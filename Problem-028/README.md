# Project Euler Problem - 28
## `Number Spiral Diagonals`
## Problem Statement

Project Euler Problem 28 requires finding the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an `n Ã— n` spiral formed in a specific way, where `n` is an odd number starting from 1 and increasing by 2 on each layer outward. The spiral starts with the number 1 at the center and moves to the right, then up, left, down, and continues spiraling outward. The task is to find the sum of the numbers on both diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral.

## Objectives

1. Calculate the sum of all numbers on the diagonals in a 1001x1001 spiral.
2. Develop an efficient algorithm that can handle this calculation without the need to explicitly construct the entire spiral matrix.
