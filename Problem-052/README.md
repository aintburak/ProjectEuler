# Project Euler - Problem 52

## `Permuted Multiples`

### Problem Statement

It can be seen that the number 125874 and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, `x`, such that `2x`, `3x`, `4x`, `5x`, and `6x` contain the same digits as `x`.

### Instructions

1. Iterate through positive integers starting from 1.
2. For each integer `x`, check if the numbers `2x`, `3x`, `4x`, `5x`, and `6x` contain the same digits as `x`.
3. Identify the smallest integer `x` that meets the criteria.
4. Output the result.

### Example

For the number 125874:
- 2 Ã— 125874 = 251748, which contains the same digits as 125874.

### Discussion

This problem involves checking numbers and their multiples for digit permutations. Efficiently comparing the digit compositions of numbers is key to solving this problem within the given constraints.
