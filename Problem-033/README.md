# Project Euler Problem - 33
## `Digit Cancelling Fractions`

## Problem Statement

The task is to find all fractions where the numerator is less than the denominator, and the digits in the numerator and denominator can be "cancelled" to yield a simplified fraction that is equal to the original fraction. This cancellation involves removing a digit from the numerator and the denominator, and is only considered valid if the digits are non-zero and identical, and the digit cancellation leads to a simpler fraction that equals the original fraction mathematically.

For example, in the fraction 49/98, you can cancel out the 9s to get 4/8, which simplifies further to 1/2, thus making 49/98 a curious fraction.

## Objectives

1. Identify all fractions with two digits in the numerator and the denominator that exhibit this "digit cancelling" property.
2. Determine the product of these fractions in its simplest form.
