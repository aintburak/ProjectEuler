## `Pentagon Numbers`

### Problem Statement

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimized; what is the value of D?

### Instructions

1. Implement a function or algorithm to generate pentagonal numbers.
2. Create a function to check if a number is pentagonal.
3. Find the pair of pentagonal numbers that satisfy the given conditions.
4. Compute their difference and determine the minimum value of D.

### Example

For the given sequence of pentagonal numbers: [1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...], the pair (70, 22) satisfies the conditions, as their sum and difference are pentagonal (92 = P8 and 48 = 70 - 22 = P4).

### Discussion

This problem involves generating pentagonal numbers efficiently and then checking for pairs that meet the specified criteria. Since the sequence of pentagonal numbers grows quite rapidly, an optimized algorithm for generating and testing pentagonal numbers will be essential for solving this problem efficiently.
