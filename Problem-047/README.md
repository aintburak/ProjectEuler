## `Distinct Primes Factors`

### Problem Statement

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors each are:
- 14 = 2 × 7
- 15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors each are:
- 644 = 2² × 7 × 23
- 645 = 3 × 5 × 43
- 646 = 2 × 17 × 19

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

### Instructions

1. Identify the first sequence of four consecutive integers where each number has exactly four distinct prime factors.
2. Provide the solution without revealing the code implementation.
3. If you choose to share your solution, avoid posting the code on public forums or repositories.
4. Reflect on the approach you took to solve the problem.

### Example

For three consecutive numbers:
- 644, 645, and 646 each have exactly three distinct prime factors.

### Discussion

This problem involves not only prime factorization but also a systematic way to check consecutive integers. Efficient algorithms for prime factorization and checking consecutive numbers are essential.
